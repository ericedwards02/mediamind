  review: `A harrowing work of blunt, unglamorous political instruction and conviction, and one of the great pieces of armed revolutionary cinema. A claustrophobic, maze-like, and yet clear-eyed depiction of on-the-ground human suffering under brutal colonial rule as well as a thrilling, grit-textured newsreel procedural documentation of organized guerrilla resistance thatâ€™s so authentic it was studied by both left-wing and right-wing groups for possible insights into their opponents. It takes a very real, overwhelming geopolitical situation and realizes it in the POV of human eyes and ears (the constant machinery of the sound design in helicopters, loudspeakers, guns, etc vs. the wails of the people) that very effectively capture the act of witnessing, and material solidarity and ideological martyrdom that are all necessary to see the anti-imperial project through to the end.

  Obviously there is a lot of incredible detail to unpack, but the sequence that stands out is of the three Algerian women planting bombs in the French district. Up until this point in the film Pontecorvo methodically avoids humanizing the French colonists in both character and framing (reserving warmth and close-ups for the Algerian people, reducing the military to the malicious, clinical presence it historically was), but briefly in this scene, we see the evocative flashes of French civilians singing, dancing, eating, laughing; we've entered the perspective of these women as they acknowledge that, in the name of liberation, of life, they're about to slaughter. Yet Pontecorvo doesn't frame this for simplistic hypocrisy but a much more complicated, tragic acceptance inherent to the use of force and achieving political goals under violent conditions.`,
